BluMonkey-Quad
==============

This is the github repository to my personal project of constructing and coding a quadrotor! 

This project has proved to be one of the tougher projects I've ever been involved in since it requires
a working knowledge of programming, CAD, fabrication, and electronics. I have thoroughly enjoyed the 
chance to work from the high level of control system algorithms all the way down to interfacing with
particular registers hidden within a sensor. It's really given me a comprehensive understanding of
robotics.

Please learn what you can, grab what you want from this code, and check out my blog
